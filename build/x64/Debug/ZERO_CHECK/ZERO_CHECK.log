         Checking Build System
         CMake is re-running because D:/Urho3d/Hello/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
           the file 'D:/Urho3d/Hello/CMakeLists.txt'
           is newer than 'D:/Urho3d/Hello/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'
           result='-1'
         CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:16 (cmake_policy):
           The OLD behavior for policy CMP0026 will be removed from a future version
           of CMake.
         
           The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
           policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
           specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
           behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
